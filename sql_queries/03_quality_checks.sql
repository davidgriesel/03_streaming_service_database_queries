-- the analysis for logic and business checks (Refer Section 5).

-- INSIGHTS
-- Duplicate records were identified in the actor and inventory tables.
-- Duplicates are expected in the inventory table due to stores holding more than one
-- physical copy per title distinguished only by inventory_id.

-- RECOMMENDATIONS
-- Confirm whether duplicates in the actor table reflect true data replication
-- and remove if appropriate (Refer 4.1).
-- Confirm whether duplicates in the inventory table reflect actual copies held for
-- rental in order to determine whether to remove or retain (Refer 4.1).

-- INSIGHTS
-- Several columns have extremely low distinct counts relative to total rows
-- (address.address2, and several columns in the film table).
-- There are 600 city id's but only 599 city names suggesting cities sharing a name.
-- Of the 600 city id's only 599 are linked to addresses suggesting that unless the
-- other links to a store or staff member, that there may be unusued city id's.
-- All 599 customers rented at least one film and made at least one payment.
-- Only 997 of the 1000 film titles are linked to actors (film_actor table).
-- Only 958 of the 1000 film titles are available for rent (inventory table).
-- Of the 4,581 titles in inventory, all but one were rented out at least once.
-- The payment table contains 14,596 payments linked to only 14,592 rentals.
-- Timestamp columns all show 1 distinct value supporting earlier observations of
-- uniform update behaviour.
-- Status columns show either 1 or 2 distinct records supporting binary expectation.

-- RECOMMENDATIONS
-- Remove columns with low or no variance that add no value to the analysis
-- (Refer 6.1).
-- Flag payment table as likely to contain split payments (Refer 5.3.2.3).
-- Flag city table as likely to hold unused cities.
-- Flag inventory item not rented out for physical verification (Reporting).

-- INSIGHTS
-- The address.address2 contains only null values (4) and empty strings (599).
-- Empty strings detected in address.district (3), address.phone (2), and
-- address.postal_code (4), are consistent with earlier observations.
-- London appears twice in city table.
-- Duplicates noted in one field expected to hold unique values (staff.password), but
-- others (customer.email, staff.email) all hold unique values.
-- Boolean status columns (customer.activebool, staff.active) contain only one value
-- (true) while status column of type integer contain 0 and 1 (customer.active).
-- Two spelling errors in country.country - Runion and Kazakstan should be Réunion
-- and Kazakhstan.
-- The country Yugoslavia does not exist anymore.
-- Numerous spelling errors in city.city - For example, Jastrzebie-Zdrj should be
-- Jastrzębie-Zdrój, guas Lindas de Gois should be Águas Lindas de Goiás, al-Ayn
-- should be Al-Ayn, and Santa Brbara dOeste should be Santa Bárbara d'Oeste.

-- RECOMMENDATIONS
-- Remove empty columns (Refer 6.1).
-- Impute empty strings in retained columns with placeholder values e.g. 'n/a'
-- (Refer 6.1).
-- Remove the redundant status column of type integer. The boolean status column
-- indicates that all customers are active, and this will be confirmed through the
-- presence of transactions, which provide a more reliable indicator of customer
-- activity (Refer 6.1).
-- Confirm that duplicate city names are valid e.g. relate to different countries.
-- Communicate duplicate passwords to management as security risk (Reporting).
-- Correct spelling mistakes in the country.country column (Refer 6.1).
-- Check which cities link to Yugoslavia to determine if the country name can be
-- updated (Refer 4.4).
-- Perform a comprehensive spell check for the city.city column to determine how
-- to handle errors (Refer 4.5).

-- INSIGHTS
-- All but one last_update columns contain a single distinct timestamp which
-- suggests singular creation rather than true update tracking. The other column
-- contains 3 distinct dates.

-- RECOMMENDATIONS
-- Remove last_update and create_date columns for analysis (Refer 6.1).

-- 3.7.2 - COUNT DISTINCT VALUES (Transaction date columns)

-- PURPOSE
-- Assess the number of distinct values in timestamp columns that track transactions
-- to assess whether these columns reflect realistic temporal patterns or static
-- entries.

-- INSIGHTS
-- A wide range of distinct values is present across all columns, indicating
-- temporal variation in transaction activity, including time components.

-- RECOMMENDATIONS
-- Cast retained timestamp columns tracking operational activity to date if
-- time-level detail is not required in the analysis (Refer 6.1).

-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- PURPOSE
-- Verify that the numeric date column holds plausible values for time-based
-- interpretation.

-- INSIGHTS
-- Only one unique value was found confirming a single release year for the

-- RECOMMENDATIONS
-- Flag film.release_year as a fixed attribute for contextual reference, not as a
-- timeline for temporal analysis.

GROUP BY payment_date::date
ORDER BY payment_date::date;

-- INSIGHTS

-- The transactional date columns (rental_date, return_date, and payment_date) show
-- five distinct periods of activity, each followed by a period of inactivity.
-- Both rental_date and payment_date conclude with a single isolated entry.
-- The return_date column includes 184 null values which agrees with earlier
-- observations.
-- The activity patterns do not reflect typical weekly, monthly, or seasonal trends.
-- Return activity typically begins one day after the first rentals which start in
-- late May 2005, but return cycles span nearly twice the duration of rental
-- periods.
-- Payment activity starts much later, in mid-February 2007 with each cycle lasting
-- around seven days.

-- RECOMMENDATIONS
-- Confirm that return_date is later than or equal to rental_date (Refer 5.3.1).
-- Confirm that payment_date is later than or equal to rental_date (Refer 5.3.2).
